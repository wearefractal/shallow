(This isn't working fully yet - stay tuned)

Shallow uses AJAX to populate and render your blog at runtime - you never have to mess with updating anything!

## Instructions

1. Edit index.html and fill in your account names. 

```javascript
var settings = {
   name: 'your blog title',
   substance: 'your substance.io username',
   github: 'your github name',
   twitter: 'your twitter name'
};
```

2. Push the the folder to github.
3. Start writing posts on substance.io!
